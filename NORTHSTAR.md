# NORTHSTAR: Phuc_Forecast — Stillwater

> "Make AI development deterministically verifiable — for any developer, on any project."
> "Be water, my friend." — Bruce Lee. Stillwater literally means still water runs deep.

## The Vision

**Stillwater = Software 5.0 OS + Verification Layer + LLM Portal**

The twin OSS projects that dominate the Verified Intelligence Economy:
1. **stillwater** (OSS) — verification + governance + skill store
2. **solace-browser** (OSS) — OAuth3 reference implementation + browser automation

Together they power **solaceagi.com** — the hosted platform (no LLM costs).

```
SOFTWARE 5.0 PARADIGM:
  Natural language → source code
  AI agents → runtime
  Evidence bundles → compiled output
  Stillwater verification → CI/CD

MASTER EQUATION:
  Intelligence(system) = Memory × Care × Iteration
  Memory = skills/*.md + recipes/*.json + swarms/*.yaml
  Care = Verification ladder (641 → 274177 → 65537)
  Iteration = Never-Worse doctrine + git versioning
```

## North Star Metrics

| Metric | Now | Q2 2026 | End 2026 |
|--------|-----|---------|---------|
| GitHub stars | ~50 | 1,000 | 10,000 |
| Projects running at rung 65537 | 0 | 2 | 8 |
| Stillwater Store skills | 7 combos | 25 skills | 100+ skills |
| Recipe hit rate (across ecosystem) | 0% | 50% | 80% |
| Community contributors | 1 | 5 | 50 |

## The Twin OSS Strategy

```
TODAY (Feb 2026):
  stillwater → Verification + LLM Portal + Skills ✅
  solace-browser → LinkedIn MVP + OAuth3 spec ✅
  Competitors: None have OAuth3 + Stillwater verification combo

END OF 2026-Q2:
  stillwater → Stillwater Store live (skill submission + review)
  solace-browser → 10 platforms, all OAuth3-bounded
  Recipe hit rate → 70% (economic moat unlocks)
  → 1,000 paying solaceagi.com users (growing)
  Stillwater Store → 25 community skill submissions/mo

END OF 2026:
  stillwater → 100+ skills, 50 contributors
  OAuth3 v1.0 → adopted by ≥1 external AI agent platform
  → 5,000 paying users (growing)
  Belt: Black — Models are commodities. Skills are capital. OAuth3 is law.
```

## The Verification Ladder (Core Product)

```
RUNG 641  → Local correctness (red/green + no regressions + evidence complete)
RUNG 274177 → Stability (seed sweep + replay + null edge sweep)
RUNG 65537 → Production confidence (adversarial + security + behavioral hash)

Belt System:
  White Belt  → rung 641 achieved
  Yellow Belt → rung 274177 achieved
  Orange Belt → first skill in Stillwater Store
  Green Belt  → rung 65537 achieved
  Black Belt  → production task running at 65537 for 30 days
```

## The Phuc Forecast Loop

```
DREAM → Every AI task produces verified, reproducible, auditable evidence
FORECAST → Developer distrust of AI outputs grows; evidence-first wins compliance
DECIDE → Open skill governance + OAuth3 + model neutrality + evidence-first
ACT → Ship Store flywheel + LLM Portal + case studies per project
VERIFY → GitHub stars + Store submissions + rung achievements + recipe hit rate
```

## What Stillwater Powers (Case Studies)

Track in case-studies/:
- `solace-browser.md` — OAuth3 browser automation
- `solace-cli.md` — solace-cli (PRIVATE extension of stillwater/cli OSS)
- `solaceagi.md` — hosted platform
- `stillwater-itself.md` — self-verification

## Key Projects + Integration

| Project | Role | Stillwater Provides |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **solace-browser** | OAuth3 reference impl | Recipe verification, evidence bundles |
| **stillwater/cli** (OSS) + **solace-cli** (PRIVATE) | Terminal surface | stillwater/cli: rung enforcement, store commands (OSS). solace-cli: OAuth3 vault, twin, cloud (PRIVATE). |
| **solaceagi.com** | Hosted cloud | Managed skill updates, OAuth3 vault |
| **stillwater** | The OS itself | Everything above |

## Competitive Position

### FDA 21 CFR Part 11 — The Regulatory Moat

SolaceAGI is the first AI agent platform architected for FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance:
- Hash-chained audit trails (tamper-evident, append-only)
- ALCOA+ data integrity (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate)
- OAuth3 = electronic signature for AI delegation
- PZip HTML snapshots = Original records (what the agent actually saw)
- Rung system = Phase gates (like clinical trial Phase I/II/III)

No competitor has this. OpenClaw has 512 security vulnerabilities and 824 malicious skills.
Token-revenue vendors (OpenAI) cannot implement OAuth3 — it reduces token consumption.

## Founder

Phuc Truong (Harvard '98). Serial founder.
- Co-founded Clinical Research IO (CRIO) — #1 eSource in FDA-regulated clinical trials
- 360+ customers, 40% higher enrollment, 70% FDA audit risk reduction
- Built software that survives real FDA audits — that experience is in the architecture
- "In clinical trials, 'trust me' is not evidence. Only the original, timestamped, attributable record is evidence."
- Previously: UpDown.com (100K users), Citystream (acquired), Phuc Labs (MIT AMD winner)
- Harvard University, A.B. Economics, Class of 1998

## Community Flywheel (Stillwater's Role)

Stillwater is the governance layer that makes the flywheel self-sustaining:

```
Skill submitted to Stillwater Store
  → Rung gate validates (641 for dev, 65537 for production)
    → Accepted skill improves recipe hit rate for ALL users
      → Higher hit rate → lower COGS → platform can serve more users
        → More users → more submissions → flywheel self-sustains

"This isn't SaaS — it's a dojo. Every submission earns belt XP."
```

**Stillwater Store submissions benefit everyone:**
- Your recipe at 70% hit rate saves every future user money
- Your prime-mermaid PM triplet makes browser navigation more reliable
- Your swarm definition routes tasks cheaper (less token waste)
- Contributors earn community belt XP — tracked in STORE.md

## The 9-Project Ecosystem

The Stillwater Network (9 Projects):

```
PUBLIC (OSS):
  stillwater     — verification + governance + skill store (THE OS)
  solace-browser — OAuth3 reference impl + twin browser
  paudio         — deterministic speech synthesis + community voices
  phucnet        — personal site + articles + books (phuc.net)
  if             — IF Theory physics research (information as first force)
  pzip           — universal compression engine

PRIVATE:
  solace-cli     — extends stillwater/cli with OAuth3 vault + twin + cloud
  solaceagi      — hosted platform (solaceagi.com)
  pvideo         — physics-based video/avatar generation (secret sauce)
  solace-marketing — marketing intelligence

AVATAR SYSTEM (solaceagi.com):
  paudio (voice) + pvideo (visual) + stillwater (verification) = AI Avatar
  → Phase 1: Cute cartoon avatar + deterministic voice
  → Phase 2: Lip-sync + expressions
  → Phase 3: Full avatar on solaceagi.com (your AI agent has a face and voice)

MASTER PLAN (pvideo):
  → Protein folding (compete with DeepMind AlphaFold)
  → Material science simulation
  → Physics simulation (compete with specialized solvers)
  → 3D printing (export STL from physics sim)
  → Video generation (compete with Sora/VEO)
  → Video encoding (replace H.265)
  → Zoom replacement (pvideo-powered conferencing)
  → Metaverse (solaceagi.com metaverse powered by pvideo + paudio)
```
