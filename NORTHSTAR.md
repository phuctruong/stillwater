# NORTHSTAR: Phuc_Forecast — Stillwater

> "Make AI development deterministically verifiable — for any developer, on any project."
> "Be water, my friend." — Bruce Lee. Stillwater literally means still water runs deep.

## The Vision

**Stillwater = Software 5.0 OS + Verification Layer + LLM Portal**

The twin OSS projects that dominate the Verified Intelligence Economy:
1. **stillwater** (OSS) — verification + governance + skill store
2. **solace-browser** (OSS) — OAuth3 reference implementation + browser automation

Together they power **solaceagi.com** — the hosted platform (no LLM costs).

```
SOFTWARE 5.0 PARADIGM:
  Natural language → source code
  AI agents → runtime
  Evidence bundles → compiled output
  Stillwater verification → CI/CD

MASTER EQUATION:
  Intelligence(system) = Memory × Care × Iteration
  Memory = skills/*.md + recipes/*.json + swarms/*.yaml
  Care = Verification ladder (641 → 274177 → 65537)
  Iteration = Never-Worse doctrine + git versioning
```

## North Star Metrics

| Metric | Now | Q2 2026 | End 2026 |
|--------|-----|---------|---------|
| GitHub stars | ~50 | 1,000 | 10,000 |
| Projects running at rung 65537 | 0 | 2 | 8 |
| Stillwater Store skills | 7 combos | 25 skills | 100+ skills |
| Recipe hit rate (across ecosystem) | 0% | 50% | 80% |
| Community contributors | 1 | 5 | 50 |

## The Twin OSS Strategy

```
TODAY (Feb 2026):
  stillwater → Verification + LLM Portal + Skills ✅
  solace-browser → LinkedIn MVP + OAuth3 spec ✅
  Competitors: None have OAuth3 + Stillwater verification combo

END OF 2026-Q2:
  stillwater → Stillwater Store live (skill submission + review)
  solace-browser → 10 platforms, all OAuth3-bounded
  Recipe hit rate → 70% (economic moat unlocks)
  → 1,000 paying solaceagi.com users (growing)
  Stillwater Store → 25 community skill submissions/mo

END OF 2026:
  stillwater → 100+ skills, 50 contributors
  OAuth3 v1.0 → adopted by ≥1 external AI agent platform
  → 5,000 paying users (growing)
  Belt: Black — Models are commodities. Skills are capital. OAuth3 is law.
```

## The Verification Ladder (Core Product)

```
RUNG 641  → Local correctness (red/green + no regressions + evidence complete)
RUNG 274177 → Stability (seed sweep + replay + null edge sweep)
RUNG 65537 → Production confidence (adversarial + security + behavioral hash)

Belt System:
  White Belt  → rung 641 achieved
  Yellow Belt → rung 274177 achieved
  Orange Belt → first skill in Stillwater Store
  Green Belt  → rung 65537 achieved
  Black Belt  → production task running at 65537 for 30 days
```

## The Phuc Forecast Loop

```
DREAM → Every AI task produces verified, reproducible, auditable evidence
FORECAST → Developer distrust of AI outputs grows; evidence-first wins compliance
DECIDE → Open skill governance + OAuth3 + model neutrality + evidence-first
ACT → Ship Store flywheel + LLM Portal + case studies per project
VERIFY → GitHub stars + Store submissions + rung achievements + recipe hit rate
```

## What Stillwater Powers (Case Studies)

Track in case-studies/:
- `solace-browser.md` — OAuth3 browser automation
- `solace-cli.md` — solace-cli (PRIVATE extension of stillwater/cli OSS)
- `solaceagi.md` — hosted platform
- `stillwater-itself.md` — self-verification

## Key Projects + Integration

| Project | Role | Stillwater Provides |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **solace-browser** | OAuth3 reference impl | Recipe verification, evidence bundles |
| **stillwater/cli** (OSS) + **solace-cli** (PRIVATE) | Terminal surface | stillwater/cli: rung enforcement, store commands (OSS). solace-cli: OAuth3 vault, twin, cloud (PRIVATE). |
| **solaceagi.com** | Hosted cloud | Managed skill updates, OAuth3 vault |
| **stillwater** | The OS itself | Everything above |

## Competitive Position

### FDA 21 CFR Part 11 — The Regulatory Moat

SolaceAGI is the first AI agent platform architected for FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance:
- Hash-chained audit trails (tamper-evident, append-only)
- ALCOA+ data integrity (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate)
- OAuth3 = electronic signature for AI delegation
- PZip HTML snapshots = Original records (what the agent actually saw)
- Rung system = Phase gates (like clinical trial Phase I/II/III)

No competitor has this. OpenClaw has 512 security vulnerabilities and 824 malicious skills.
Token-revenue vendors (OpenAI) cannot implement OAuth3 — it reduces token consumption.

## Founder

Phuc Truong (Harvard '98). Serial founder.
- Co-founded Clinical Research IO (CRIO) — #1 eSource in FDA-regulated clinical trials
- 360+ customers, 40% higher enrollment, 70% FDA audit risk reduction
- Built software that survives real FDA audits — that experience is in the architecture
- "In clinical trials, 'trust me' is not evidence. Only the original, timestamped, attributable record is evidence."
- Previously: UpDown.com (100K users), Citystream (acquired), Phuc Labs (MIT AMD winner)
- Harvard University, A.B. Economics, Class of 1998

## Community Flywheel (Stillwater's Role)

Stillwater is the governance layer that makes the flywheel self-sustaining:

```
Skill submitted to Stillwater Store
  → Rung gate validates (641 for dev, 65537 for production)
    → Accepted skill improves recipe hit rate for ALL users
      → Higher hit rate → lower COGS → platform can serve more users
        → More users → more submissions → flywheel self-sustains

"This isn't SaaS — it's a dojo. Every submission earns belt XP."
```

**Stillwater Store submissions benefit everyone:**
- Your recipe at 70% hit rate saves every future user money
- Your prime-mermaid PM triplet makes browser navigation more reliable
- Your swarm definition routes tasks cheaper (less token waste)
- Contributors earn community belt XP — tracked in STORE.md

## The 9-Project Ecosystem

The Stillwater Network (9 Projects):

```
PUBLIC (OSS):
  stillwater     — verification + governance + skill store (THE OS)
  solace-browser — OAuth3 reference impl + twin browser
  paudio         — deterministic speech synthesis + community voices
  phucnet        — personal site + articles + books (phuc.net)
  if             — IF Theory physics research (information as first force)
  pzip           — universal compression engine

PRIVATE:

  → 3D printing (export STL from physics sim)
  → Video generation (compete with Sora/VEO)
  → Video encoding (replace H.265)
  → Zoom replacement (pvideo-powered conferencing)
  → Metaverse (solaceagi.com metaverse powered by pvideo + paudio)
```

## Dragon Tip Program — BYOK Users Fund Open Source

> "Every drop fills the river." — The Dragon Tip Program turns free-tier users into open-source contributors.

### The Tip Architecture

BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) users on solaceagi.com pay nothing to the platform — they bring their own Anthropic/OpenAI/Llama API keys. The Dragon Tip Program lets them voluntarily contribute a small percentage of their API credits to fund open-source projects in the Stillwater ecosystem.

```
BYOK user sends request → solaceagi.com services it (recipe match, OAuth3 gate, evidence bundle)
  → API call goes to user's own LLM provider (zero platform cost)
    → After completion, tip % of the API credit cost is allocated to OSS fund
      → Every tip-funded API call is Part 11 logged with hash-chained audit trail
        → User can verify exactly what their contribution built
```

### Dragon Tiers

| Tier | Tip % | Motto | Badge |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
| Dragon Contributor | 2% | "Every drop fills the river" | Dragon |
| Super Dragon | 5% | "The river that gives, grows" | Super Dragon |
| Elder Dragon | 8% | "Ancient wisdom funds the future" | Elder Dragon |
| Legendary Dragon | 9%+ (custom) | "Your generosity builds the dojo" | Legendary Dragon |

### What Tips Fund

Tips flow directly to OSS projects in the Stillwater ecosystem:

```
Tip fund allocation (transparent, Part 11 audited):
  paudio    — deterministic speech synthesis + community voices
  pvideo    — physics-based video/avatar generation
  stillwater — verification OS itself (skills, store, governance)
  solace-browser — OAuth3 reference implementation
  pzip      — universal compression engine
  Community bounties — bug fixes, new skills, new recipes
```

### Stillwater Store Integration

Dragon tippers earn Dragon badges displayed on their Stillwater Store profile:
- Badge appears on all skills they submit (social proof)
- Dragon-badged skill authors get priority review in the Store submission queue
- Legendary Dragons get a permanent "Dojo Patron" marker on their Store profile

### Belt Progression Enhancement

Dragon contributions count toward belt XP in the Stillwater belt system:

```
Belt XP from Dragon Tips:
  Dragon Contributor (2%) → +50 XP/month
  Super Dragon (5%)       → +150 XP/month
  Elder Dragon (8%)       → +300 XP/month
  Legendary Dragon (9%+)  → +500 XP/month + custom XP multiplier

XP stacks with existing belt progression:
  Skill submissions + rung achievements + recipe contributions + Dragon tips
  → Accelerated path from White Belt to Black Belt
```

### Part 11 Transparency — The Trust Enabler

"Your tips don't disappear into a corporate treasury. Every hundredth of a cent is Part 11 logged. You can verify exactly what your contribution built. This is open-source funding with FDA-grade transparency."

```
Part 11 audit trail for every tip:
  tip_id:          SHA-256 hash (unique, content-addressed)
  user_id:         anonymized (privacy-preserving)
  tip_amount_usd:  exact Decimal (no float)
  api_call_cost:   upstream LLM cost that triggered the tip
  tip_percentage:  user's chosen tier (2%, 5%, 8%, or custom)
  funded_project:  which OSS project received the allocation
  funded_task:     specific commit/PR/bounty the tip contributed to
  timestamp:       ISO8601, append-only ledger
  chain_hash:      SHA-256(previous_entry + this_entry) — tamper-evident

Savings Dashboard (user-facing):
  - Recipe hit rate: "Your recipes saved X calls this month"
  - Tokens saved: "Y tokens not consumed thanks to cached recipes"
  - Money saved: "$Z.ZZ saved vs cold LLM calls"
  - Tips given: "$W.WW contributed to OSS this month"
  - Impact: "Your tips funded N commits across M projects"
```

### Revenue Projection

```
At 10,000 BYOK users with average 3% tip rate:
  Average BYOK user API spend: ~$15/month
  Average tip per user: $0.45/month
  Total monthly OSS fund: $4,500/month = $54,000/year
  → Funds 2-3 full-time OSS maintainers
  → Or 50+ community bounties per month
  → All verifiable via Part 11 audit trail
```
