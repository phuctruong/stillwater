# NORTHSTAR: Phuc_Forecast — Stillwater

> "Make AI development deterministically verifiable — for any developer, on any project."

## The Vision

**Stillwater = Software 5.0 OS + Verification Layer + LLM Portal**

The twin OSS projects that dominate the Verified Intelligence Economy:
1. **stillwater** (OSS) — verification + governance + skill store
2. **solace-browser** (OSS) — OAuth3 reference implementation + browser automation

Together they power **solaceagi.com** — the hosted platform (no LLM costs).

```
SOFTWARE 5.0 PARADIGM:
  Natural language → source code
  AI agents → runtime
  Evidence bundles → compiled output
  Stillwater verification → CI/CD

MASTER EQUATION:
  Intelligence(system) = Memory × Care × Iteration
  Memory = skills/*.md + recipes/*.json + swarms/*.yaml
  Care = Verification ladder (641 → 274177 → 65537)
  Iteration = Never-Worse doctrine + git versioning
```

## North Star Metrics

| Metric | Now | Q2 2026 | End 2026 |
|--------|-----|---------|---------|
| GitHub stars | ~50 | 1,000 | 10,000 |
| Projects running at rung 65537 | 0 | 2 | 8 |
| Stillwater Store skills | 7 combos | 25 skills | 100+ skills |
| Recipe hit rate (across ecosystem) | 0% | 50% | 80% |
| Community contributors | 1 | 5 | 50 |

## The Twin OSS Strategy

```
TODAY (Feb 2026):
  stillwater → Verification + LLM Portal + Skills ✅
  solace-browser → LinkedIn MVP + OAuth3 spec ✅
  Competitors: None have OAuth3 + Stillwater verification combo

END OF 2026-Q2:
  stillwater → Stillwater Store live (skill submission + review)
  solace-browser → 10 platforms, all OAuth3-bounded
  Recipe hit rate → 70% (economic moat unlocks)
  → 1,000 paying solaceagi.com users = $19K MRR

END OF 2026:
  stillwater → 100+ skills, 50 contributors
  OAuth3 v1.0 → adopted by ≥1 external AI agent platform
  → 5,000 paying users = $95K MRR
  Belt: ⬛ Black — Models are commodities. Skills are capital. OAuth3 is law.
```

## The Verification Ladder (Core Product)

```
RUNG 641  → Local correctness (red/green + no regressions + evidence complete)
RUNG 274177 → Stability (seed sweep + replay + null edge sweep)
RUNG 65537 → Production confidence (adversarial + security + behavioral hash)

Belt System:
  White Belt  → rung 641 achieved
  Yellow Belt → rung 274177 achieved
  Orange Belt → first skill in Stillwater Store
  Green Belt  → rung 65537 achieved
  Black Belt  → production task running at 65537 for 30 days
```

## The Phuc Forecast Loop

```
DREAM → Every AI task produces verified, reproducible, auditable evidence
FORECAST → Developer distrust of AI outputs grows; evidence-first wins compliance
DECIDE → Open skill governance + OAuth3 + model neutrality + evidence-first
ACT → Ship Store flywheel + LLM Portal + case studies per project
VERIFY → GitHub stars + Store submissions + rung achievements + recipe hit rate
```

## What Stillwater Powers (Case Studies)

Track in case-studies/:
- `solace-browser.md` — OAuth3 browser automation
- `solace-cli.md` — terminal-native CLI
- `solaceagi.md` — hosted platform
- `stillwater-itself.md` — self-verification

## Key Projects + Integration

| Project | Role | Stillwater Provides |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **solace-browser** | OAuth3 reference impl | Recipe verification, evidence bundles |
| **solace-cli** | Terminal surface | Rung enforcement, store install/submit |
| **solaceagi.com** | Hosted cloud | Managed skill updates, OAuth3 vault |
| **stillwater** | The OS itself | Everything above |
