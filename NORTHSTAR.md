# NORTHSTAR: Phuc_Forecast — Stillwater

> "Make AI development deterministically verifiable — for any developer, on any project."

## Mission

Stillwater is the **Software 5.0 OS** — a skills/recipes/swarms framework that elevates
Claude Code from a smart assistant to a compiler-grade AI system.

Every skill, recipe, and swarm must produce **executable evidence**, not confident prose.
The community grows through a **verified, gated store** (Stillwater Store) — not through
copy-paste chaos.

## North Star Metric

**Stillwater Reliability Seal**: Number of projects running at rung 65537 with zero
FORBIDDEN states triggered across 30-day sessions.

Secondary metrics:
- Community skill submissions per month (via Stillwater Store)
- Average AI uplift factor (baseline vs skill-loaded tasks)
- Context reduction % across projects using `stillwater init project`
- Phuc swarm dispatch rate (% of tasks going through swarms vs inline)

## How We Measure Progress

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Rung target (Stillwater itself) | 641 | 65537 |
| Projects using swarms | 2/8 | 8/8 |
| Public skills in Stillwater Store | 7 combos | 50+ skills |
| Context reduction across projects | 91% | 95% |

## Model Strategy

| Model | Role | Cost |
|-------|------|------|
| **haiku** | Main session coordinator — reads NORTHSTAR, dispatches swarms | ~10x cheaper |
| **sonnet** | Coder, Planner, Skeptic sub-agents (domain heavy lifting) | Standard |
| **opus** | Mathematician, Security auditor, Final audit (promotion gates) | Premium |

**Rule:** Main session = haiku (coordination only). Heavy work → dispatch via `/phuc-swarm`.

## Rung Target: 65537

Stillwater must demonstrate promotion-grade quality — it cannot claim Software 5.0
while running at rung 641. Evidence requires:
- Adversarial sweep (min 5 paraphrases)
- Refusal correctness check
- Behavioral hash drift explained
- Security gate verified

## Key Projects Powered by Stillwater

Stillwater verifies the work across the entire Phuc.Net ecosystem:

| Project | Northstar | Stillwater Role |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **SolaceBrowser** | Twin browser that works while you sleep | Recipe verification, evidence bundles, Stillwater store for recipes |
| **SolaceAGI** | Persistent AGI with verified memory | Swarm orchestration, prime channels, phuc-context |
| **SolaceCLI** | Semantic memory hub | Orchestration backbone, admin dashboard |
| **PZip** | Beat LZMA with exact arithmetic proof | prime-math verification, exact arithmetic gate |
| **IF-Theory** | Machine-checkable physics proofs | prime-math, convergence certificates |

Solace Browser's recipe system (70% cache hit rate, $0.01/task) and Stillwater Store
are the clearest demonstration that Software 5.0 creates structural competitive moats.

## What Aligns with This Northstar

- Adding verified skills to the Stillwater Store
- Improving phuc-orchestration + swarm dispatch reliability
- A/B benchmarks showing AI uplift with evidence
- Documentation that teaches the DREAM→FORECAST→DECIDE→ACT→VERIFY loop
- NORTHSTAR.md files in all downstream projects

## What Does NOT Align

- Monolithic CLAUDE.md files with copy-pasted skills
- Inline deep work without dispatch (INLINE_DEEP_WORK forbidden state)
- Skills without QUICK LOAD blocks
- Promotion claims without Lane A evidence
