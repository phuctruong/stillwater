## Email Draft

Hi [Name],

Quick launch update: I just open-sourced **Stillwater**.

This repo is documentation-first, and it’s designed for people who want AI work to be **reviewable and reproducible**, not just “it sounded confident.” It includes runnable notebooks, a papers/ index, and a set of reusable “skills” for coding/math/safety/orchestration.

Repo: https://github.com/phuctruong/stillwater

What’s different (in plain English):
- The notebooks run in **offline demo mode by default** (no keys, no servers).
- If you want LLM-backed runs, you can enable them with a local wrapper flow.
- The focus is on turning outputs into **auditable artifacts** (something a real engineer can inspect without guessing what happened).

Why I’m sending this:
- I’d love your eyes on it: what’s confusing, what’s missing, what feels like “this could become a real standard” vs “this is spicy fan fiction.”
- If you know someone who lives and dies by reproducibility (ML infra, security, finance, medical, devtools), an intro would help.

The honest status:
- Parts are demo-grade (intentionally portable).
- Parts are the real skeleton of what I want to build publicly.
- The goal isn’t “trust me.” It’s “here are the receipts, rerun them.”

Also: yes, I made the docs a little funny. Life is short, entropy is forever, and GitHub is a harsh place to be humorless.

If you have 5 minutes, the best path is:
1. Read `MESSAGE-TO-HUMANITY.md`
2. Run `PHUC-ORCHESTRATION-SECRET-SAUCE.ipynb`
3. Skim `papers/00-index.md`

Thanks for being in my corner.
