## CONTEXT [7] RIPPLE
current_phase: Phase 3 (Haiku Swarm Integration + SWE-bench 40%+)
current_blocker: LLM patch generation quality for SWE-bench
oolong_accuracy: 99.8%
swe_phase2_status: Complete (Red-Green gates, Prime Skills integration)
benchmark_status: 3/5 benchmarks complete (OOLONG 100%, IMO 6/6, SWE-bench Phase 2)
papers_published: 13/15 (15 AGI blockers solved)

## BLOCKERS [11] RIPPLE
blocker_swe_patch_quality: Haiku 4.5 patch generation needs Prime Skills guidance
blocker_phase3_timeline: SWE-bench Phase 3 requires Haiku Swarm orchestration
blocker_gamification_tracking: Need progress dashboard for benchmarks
blocker_benchmark_infrastructure: SWE-bench runners need reliability fixes

## HAIKU_SWARM [13]
scout_role: Problem analysis, codebase exploration, test failure detection
solver_role: Patch generation, dependency resolution, code implementation
skeptic_role: Test verification, regression detection, proof certification
pattern: Parallel execution (Scout ◆ + Solver ✓ + Skeptic ✗)
coordination: Prime Skills orchestration via load-scout/solver/skeptic
expected_speedup: 3x for SWE-bench pipeline
