# Persistent Intelligence And Books

## Thesis

A stateless model can perform.  
A persistent system can learn.

Stillwater CLI uses books and identity files as durable cognition scaffolding outside model weights.

## Book Grounding

- `books/PERSISTENT-INTELLIGENCE.md`
- `books/HOW-HUMANS-OUTSOURCED-THEIR-MINDS.md`

These frame the same systems idea:
- intelligence compounds when memory survives the body/session.

## Implementation In CLI

- Book interfaces:
  - `stillwater books list`
  - `stillwater books show <name>`
  - `stillwater twin "/books"`
- Paper interfaces:
  - `stillwater papers list`
  - `stillwater papers show <name>`
  - `stillwater twin "/papers"`
- Identity surfaces:
  - `cli/identity/SOUL.md`
  - `cli/identity/IDENTITY.md`
  - `cli/identity/MEMORY.md`
  - `cli/identity/RIPPLE-IDENTITY.prime-mermaid.md`

## Learning Loop

1. Observe failures in runs/notebooks.
2. Capture into wish + prime-mermaid state.
3. Promote stable logic into skills/recipes.
4. Verify with tests and replay hashes.
5. Preserve as docs/books/papers for future sessions and future models.

This is "mind outside body" in operational form.
