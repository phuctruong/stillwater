# HEARTBEAT

Operational cadence:
1. `qa-fast` every implementation cycle.
2. `qa-notebooks` before capability claims.
3. full `qa` before reference-release updates.

Escalation:
- if deterministic checks fail, stop promotion and fix root cause.
- if notebook evidence is missing, downgrade claim confidence.
