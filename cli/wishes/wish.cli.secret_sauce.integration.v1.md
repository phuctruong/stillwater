# Wish: `wish.cli.secret_sauce.integration.v1`

Date: 2026-02-19  
Level: L1  
Skills: `phuc-forecast`, `phuc-swarms`, `prime-wishes`, `prime-coder`, `prime-safety`, `phuc-context`

## Quest + belt

- Quest: "Game of Death Integration"
- Current belt: `Green Belt`
- Target belt: `Brown Belt`
- Promotion gate: secret-sauce notebooks are mapped to executable CLI commands and parity tests pass

## Capability

Bridge root secret-sauce assets directly into CLI workflows:
1. orchestration secret sauce -> stack/twin orchestration paths
2. skills secret sauce -> skills-ab receipts and report paths
3. prime mermaid secret sauce -> recipe lint and contract governance

## Non-goals

- no hidden memory-only behavior
- no disconnected notebook demos with no CLI equivalent

## Acceptance tests

1. each root notebook has a matching CLI parity test.
2. `stillwater recipe list` includes secret-sauce integration recipes.
3. `stillwater books list` exposes persistence books for context workflows.
