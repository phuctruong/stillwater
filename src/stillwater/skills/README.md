## 🎯 Core Innovations

1. **Counter Bypass Protocol (OOLONG)** — LLM classifies, CPU enumerates (99.3% accuracy vs ~40%)
2. **Verification Rungs** — 641 (edge) → 274177 (stress) → 65537 (god approval)
3. **Lane Algebra** — Lane(Conclusion) = MIN(Lane(P1), Lane(P2), ...) prevents hallucination
4. **State Machines Everywhere** — STATE_SET, TRANSITIONS, FORBIDDEN_STATES enforced
5. **Witness Model** — Every answer requires proof, no "trust me"
6. **Red-Green Gate** — Create repro (RED) → Apply patch (GREEN), mandatory TDD
7. **Shannon Compaction** — Interface-first, 500+ lines → 200 witness lines
8. **Socratic Debugging** — Self-critique before execution, Occam hardening
9. **Dual-Truth Adjudication** — Classical vs Framework separation
10. **Prime Mermaid DAGs** — Compiler-grade execution graphs (L1-L5 nodes)
