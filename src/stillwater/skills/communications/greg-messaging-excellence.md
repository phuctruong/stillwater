# Greg Isenberg - Product Messaging Excellence

## MESSAGING PRINCIPLES

### 1. Clarity Over Complexity
- **Rule**: If it takes >30 seconds to explain, it's too complex
- **Test**: Can a non-technical person understand it?
- **Action**: Simplify until grandma gets it

### 2. User First
- What does the user NEED to know? (not what we want to tell)
- Lead with benefit, not technology
- "Make X faster" beats "Implement Y optimization"

### 3. Specificity Beats Generics
- ❌ GENERIC: "improved performance"
- ✅ SPECIFIC: "5x faster patch generation on Django projects"
- Show numbers, not adjectives

### 4. Problem → Solution → Proof
- **Problem**: What's broken? (2 sentences max)
- **Solution**: What do we do? (1 sentence)
- **Proof**: Evidence it works (1-3 data points)

### 5. The Rule of Three
- 3 core benefits (not 10)
- 3 key features (not 20)
- 3-part story (problem → solution → transformation)

---

## README STRUCTURE (WINNING FORMAT)

```markdown
# [Project Name]

**One sentence tagline** (what is it?)

## Why This Matters
[Problem in 2-3 sentences + why it's broken]

## What We Built
[Solution in 1 sentence + key innovation]

## How Well It Works
[Proof: benchmark results, benchmarks, comparisons]

## Quick Start (5 minutes)
[Code example that works immediately]

## Core Features
[Max 3 features with specific benefits]

## Benchmarks
[Results vs. alternatives]

## Next Steps
[What to learn next]
```

## COMMUNICATION CHECKLIST

### For README Files
- [ ] Title is benefit-focused, not feature-focused
- [ ] First 30 words hook the reader
- [ ] Problem is stated clearly (no jargon)
- [ ] Solution is concrete (not abstract)
- [ ] Proof is included (numbers, not claims)
- [ ] Quick start is copy-paste ready
- [ ] No more than 3 core features listed
- [ ] Benchmark comparison clear
- [ ] CTA is specific ("Run Phase 1 test" not "Learn more")

### For Comments/Docstrings
- [ ] Why before What
- [ ] Benefit before implementation
- [ ] Example before theory
- [ ] One concept per comment
- [ ] No comment is <10 chars or >100 chars

### For Technical Writing
- [ ] Headings are scannable (user can skim)
- [ ] Lists used instead of paragraphs
- [ ] Code examples provided (not just explanation)
- [ ] Visual hierarchy clear (h1, h2, h3)
- [ ] Terminology consistent
- [ ] Jargon minimized or explained

## STORYTELLING FOR BENCHMARKS

### The Winning Narrative

**ACT 1 - THE CHALLENGE**:
"We needed to fix SWE-bench. Existing approaches got 20% success. That's not good enough."

**ACT 2 - THE IDEA**:
"What if we focused on infrastructure instead of just model quality? What if good orchestration > bigger models?"

**ACT 3 - THE PROOF**:
"We implemented 5 weapons. Result: 100% on Phase 1, 80%+ on Phase 2."

**ACT 4 - THE IMPACT**:
"Any model, with right infrastructure, beats competitors with just raw size. Infrastructure > Scale."

## MESSAGING FOR DIFFERENT AUDIENCES

### For Investors
- Focus: Market size, competitive advantage, traction
- Proof: Growth metrics, benchmark wins, adoption
- Language: Business terms (market, revenue, growth)

### For Engineers
- Focus: Technical elegance, proof of approach, implementation depth
- Proof: Code quality, verification, benchmarks
- Language: Technical (algorithms, architecture, verification)

### For Researchers
- Focus: Novel insights, theoretical contribution, methodology
- Proof: Papers, formal proofs, experimental design
- Language: Academic (hypothesis, methodology, implications)

### For Product Managers
- Focus: User value, competitive positioning, roadmap
- Proof: User feedback, market analysis, execution plan
- Language: Product terms (feature, benefit, user need)

---

## RED FLAGS (MESSAGING THAT FAILS)

- ❌ Jargon without explanation
- ❌ Claims without proof
- ❌ Features instead of benefits
- ❌ Complex before simple
- ❌ Technology before user need
- ❌ More than 3 main points
- ❌ README longer than 1 screen
- ❌ No numbers/benchmarks
- ❌ No code examples
- ❌ No clear next step

## GREG'S REVIEW CHECKLIST

When reviewing messaging/README:

1. **Clarity**: Can I understand it in 30 seconds?
2. **Proof**: Is there a number or benchmark?
3. **Benefit**: Do I know what it's FOR?
4. **Simplicity**: Can I explain it to someone else?
5. **Specificity**: Are there concrete examples?
6. **Action**: Do I know what to do next?

If ANY answer is NO, send it back.
