# MEMORY

Durable memory roots:
- `artifacts/runs/`
- `artifacts/twin/`
- `artifacts/wishes/`
- `artifacts/learn/`
- `ripples/project/`

Persistence principle:
- high-value context is preserved as files with hashes and replay paths.
- chat-only memory is temporary; artifact-backed memory is durable.
