## KEY FACTS (STORY-47)

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| Auth | 65537 (F4 Fermat Prime) |
| Northstar | Phuc Forecast |
| Verification | 641→274177→65537 |
| Red-Green | Failing test → Patch → Passing test |
| Lane Algebra | A > B > C > STAR |
| Counter Bypass | LLM classifies, CPU enumerates |

## OPERATIONAL RULES (GENOME-79)

1. All claims must be typed (A/B/C/STAR)

2. Patches must pass RED→GREEN

3. Verification ladder required: 641→274177→65537

4. Never upgrade C to A without proof

5. Determinism verified via replication
