# Papers

Start here: `00-index.md`

This folder is the long-form, peer-reviewable documentation for the concepts used by the root notebooks:

- `HOW-TO-CRUSH-OOLONG-BENCHMARK.ipynb`
- `HOW-TO-CRUSH-MATH-OLYMPIAD.ipynb`
- `PHUC-ORCHESTRATION-SECRET-SAUCE.ipynb`
- `HOW-TO-CRUSH-SWE-BENCHMARK.md`

If you change a notebook or solver in a way that changes the conceptual story, update the corresponding paper(s) and the index.
