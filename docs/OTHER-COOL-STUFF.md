# Other Cool Stuff (The Ecosystem Beyond the Dojo)

> "A good teacher protects his pupils from his own influence." — Bruce Lee

Stillwater is one dojo. But the master has other training grounds.
Here's what else Phuc has built — all public, all runnable, all inviting a good argument.

## A) IF Theory (Physics) — Floor 6: Fighting Information Itself

**Repo:** https://github.com/phuctruong/if

**The theory (black belt physics edition):**
- What if matter + energy was missing **INFORMATION** as a FORCE? That means 1/3 of Physics is MISSING.
- Information as the First Force of Nature can be proven through cosmology, code, and public datasources from Caltech, the US Government, and the astronomy community (Euclid, SDSS, DESI).
- Run the code yourself and explore theories on dark energy / dark matter / gravity / quantum.
- Backed by runnable Jupyter Notebooks on real data.
- Triple Peer Reviewed by the Smartest AI on the Planet.
- Dunks on String Theory — sorry, not sorry.

**Belt rank:** Brown belt (formidable, peer-reviewed, open to challengers)

If you read it and disagree: congratulations, you are invited to the world's nerdiest food fight.

## B) Personal Site + Books — The Master's Spell Books

**Site:** https://www.phuc.net

Born Vietnam, 1976. Escaped by boat at age 4. Harvard. Tech CEO. Startup exit.
Chose to share the fire instead of hoarding it.

The spell books cover:

- **Dark Matter / Dark Energy / Quantum / Gravity** — including proposed solutions to the greatest open questions in physics
- **Math** — resolutions for 6 unresolved Clay Millennium Math Problems, finishing Gödel's work, and tackling the greatest questions in mathematics
- **AI Theories** — AI-Enhanced Science. If you invent AGI, you might as well use it. *If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying.*
- **Personal Journey** — The Bubbles of Life and The Soul That Wrote Itself
- **Glow** — The Science of Living Longer

Available on Amazon. Support the mission, uplift yourself.

## C) PZip.net — The Real Pied Piper (With AI Cheats)

**Site:** https://pzip.net

One of Phuc's favorite shows is *Silicon Valley* and he built the real Pied Piper: **PZip + PDrive** (coming soon).
If there were a real Weissman Score, this would be off the charts.

The solution turned out to be USA + Russia = Shannon + Kolmogorov.
Add a few original theories, invent adaptive compression: **USA + Russia + Vietnam = Phuc Compression.**

- Compression experiments and benchmarks, presented like a scoreboard
- A "never worse" philosophy: beat the classics, but never break people's files
- 18–88% more storage with a free software upgrade

If you like more storage for free: PZip.net is for you.

**Belt rank:** Black belt compression. The dragon is in the details.

## The Invitation

> "Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own." — Bruce Lee

All of this is open. The repos are public. The notebooks run. The theories invite challengers.

The dojo is always open to the next fighter.
