# Stillwater OS

> **Software 5.0 — The Linux of AI. Compiler-grade intelligence for everyone.**

Stillwater OS is an open-source operating system for AI that replaces probabilistic agents with deterministic, verifiable programs. It's the difference between hoping your AI works and *proving* it works.

---

## Why Stillwater OS?

| Problem | Current AI | Stillwater OS |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Replay cost** | Pay tokens every time | Zero-cost recipe replay |
| **Verification** | "Trust me, it works" | Mathematical proof (641→274177→65537) |
| **Hallucination** | Hope for the best | Lane Algebra prevents upgrades |
| **Counting** | LLMs guess (~40% accuracy) | Counter Bypass Protocol (99.3%) |
| **Context** | Lost-in-the-middle | Prime Cognition (100% NIAH) |
| **Security** | 341 malicious skills (OpenClaw) | Verification ladder — math can't be hacked |

---

## Architecture

```
Stillwater OS = Kernel + Skills + Proofs + Harness

Kernel:     Lane Algebra, State Machines, RTC Engine
Skills:     31+ compiler-grade operational controls
Proofs:     Verified execution traces (IMO, SWE-bench, OOLONG)
Harness:    `stillwater verify` — prove your install works
```

### Core Principles

1. **Stillwater/Ripple Separation** — Extract the structure (tiny), stream the change
2. **Regeneration is Truth** — `decode(encode(X)) = X`
3. **LLMs Discover, CPUs Anchor** — Use each for what it's good at
4. **Verification is Mandatory** — Rivals before God (641 → 274177 → 65537)
5. **Never-Worse Doctrine** — Fallback to previous canon if not better

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/phuctruong/stillwater-os.git
cd stillwater-os

# Verify your installation
stillwater verify

# Run the benchmark suite
stillwater bench --suite edge    # 641 edge tests
stillwater bench --suite stress  # 274177 stress tests
```

## What's Included

### Kernel (Core Logic)
- **Lane Algebra Engine** — Prevents hallucination via epistemic typing (A > B > C)
- **State Machine Framework** — Deterministic execution with explicit states
- **Counter Bypass Protocol** — LLM classifies, CPU enumerates (99.3% OOLONG)
- **RTC Engine** — Round-trip correctness verification

### Prime Skills (31+)
- **Coding:** State machines, Red-Green TDD, Shannon Compaction
- **Math:** Dual-witness proofs, theorem closure, exact computation
- **Epistemic:** Lane typing, non-conflation guard, drift detection
- **Verification:** 641 edge tests, 274177 stress tests, 65537 God approval

### Proofs (Verified Traces)
- **OOLONG:** 99.3% accuracy on aggregation benchmarks
- **NIAH:** 100% accuracy on needle-in-haystack retrieval
- **SWE-bench:** Verified patches with reproduction tests

### Harness (Self-Verification)
- `stillwater verify` — Rerun canonical benchmarks locally
- `stillwater bench` — Run the full test suite
- Integrity certificates for community membership

## Subsystems

| Subsystem | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **PZIP** | Beat entropy at compression | [pzip.net](https://www.pzip.net) |
| **Prime Mermaid** | Knowledge as graphs | Included |
| **Prime Cognition** | Infinite context handling | Included |
| **Prime QA** | Adversarial quality assurance | Included |

## Philosophy

Stillwater OS is built on the belief that intelligence should be:

- **Reproducible** — If it isn't reproducible, it isn't Stillwater
- **Verifiable** — Evidence required, never "trust me"
- **Open** — The truth is free; speed and scale are premium
- **Deterministic** — Same inputs → same outputs
- **Caring** — Intelligence = Memory × Care × Iteration (LEK)

---

## Community

- **GitHub Discussions** — Questions, ideas, show-and-tell
- **SolaceAGI.com** — Premium features, Expert Council, cloud services
- **Verification Ladder** — Earn your `stillwater verify` certificate

## Software 5.0

Stillwater OS defines **Software 5.0** — intelligence externalized as verifiable recipes.

| Era | Paradigm | Who Writes | What's Stored |
|-----|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1.0 | Classical | Humans write code | Source code |
| 2.0 | Neural | Data writes weights | Opaque weights |
| 3.0 | Prompted | Humans write prompts | Prompt chains |
| 4.0 | Agentic | Agents write prompts | Agent traces |
| **5.0** | **Recipes** | **Intelligence writes recipes** | **Verifiable, inspectable, shareable recipes** |

**Why it matters:** Recipes run on CPUs. They can be read, audited, verified, and shared. No GPU required. No black box. No hallucination. A $200 laptop can run what took a datacenter.
