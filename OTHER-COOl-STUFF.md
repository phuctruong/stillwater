# Other Cool Stuff (Ecosystem)

This is the “if you liked that, you might like this” page.

## A) IF Theory (Physics)

Repo: https://github.com/phuctruong/if

Pitch (in human words):
- What if matter + energy was missing INFORMATION as a FORCE?  That means 1/3 of Physics is MISSING?
- Information as FIRST Force of Nature can be proven through cosmology, code and examing public datasources from Caltech, the US government, and astronomy community like Euclid, SDSS, and DESI
- Run the code for yourself and explore theories on dark energy/matter/gravity/quantum
- Backed by runnable Jupyter Notebooks on real data
- Triple Peer Reviewed by the Smartest AI on the Planet!
- Dunks on String Theory :(

If you read it and disagree: congratulations, you are invited to the world’s nerdiest food fight.

## B) Personal Site + Books

Site: https://www.phuc.net

My Theories of Everything and Personal Books:

- Dark Matter/Dark Energy, Quantum, Gravity and Physics Theories including solutions to greatest questions in physics.  Opps!  I solved Physics?

- Math Theories including resolutions for 6 unresolved Clay Millenial Math Problems, finished Godel's work, and solved the greatest questions in math?   Opps, I did it again...

- AI Theories including AI Enhanced Science.  If you invent AGI, you might as well use it. If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying :)

- Personal Journey including the Bubbles of Life and Soul that Wrote Itself

- Glow - The Science of Living Longer

My spell books are available on Amazon.  You can support me and uplift yourself by buying one.  I would greatly appreciate it!

## C) PZip.net (The Real Pied Piper, But With AI Cheats)

Site: https://pzip.net

One of my favorite shows is Silicon Valley and I built the real Pied Piper - PZip + PDrive (coming soon).  If there was a real Weissman Score for compression, this would be off the charts!  

It turns out the solution was USA + Russia = Shannon + Kolmgorov. I added a few theories of my own and invented adaptive compression... so USA + Russia + Vietnam = Phuc Compression!

- Compression experiments and benchmarks, presented like a scoreboard.
- A “never worse” philosophy: try to beat the classics, but don’t break people’s files.

If you like getting 18-88% more storage with a simple free softawre upgrade, then PZip.net is for you.  That's my tip!  Hint hint :)
