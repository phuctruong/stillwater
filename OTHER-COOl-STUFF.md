# Other Cool Stuff (Ecosystem)

This is the “if you liked that, you might like this” page.

## A) IF Theory (Physics)

Repo: https://github.com/phuctruong/if

Pitch (in human words):
- A set of theories on dark energy/matter/gravity/quantum framed as “information-first physics”.
- Presented as something you can scrutinize and argue with (preferably with math, not vibes).

If you read it and disagree: congratulations, you are invited to the world’s nerdiest food fight.

## B) Personal Site + Books

Site: https://www.phuc.net

Books (from the site’s Books section):
- Prime Physics
- Prime Theory
- Primes Theory
- The Gravity of Primes
- Unified Prime Theory

Also: if you can find something that makes you laugh and makes you smarter, that’s basically the whole brand.

## C) PZip.net (The Real Pied Piper, But With AI Cheats)

Site: https://pzip.net

The vibe:
- Compression experiments and benchmarks, presented like a scoreboard.
- A “never worse” philosophy: try to beat the classics, but don’t break people’s files.

Yes, the Silicon Valley references are intentional.
No, I will not confirm whether the dragon was used in production.
