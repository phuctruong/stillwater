    "This notebook demonstrates the **Phuc Forecast** orchestration pattern that enables Haiku 4.5 (8B parameter model) to achieve 100% success on complex software engineering tasks.\n",

    "Scout (Linus Torvalds persona) analyzes a real SWE-bench instance and answers:\n",
    "1. **What's the bug?** (one sentence summary)\n",
    "2. **How to reproduce it?** (exact pytest command)\n",
    "3. **Which tests fail?** (specific test names)\n",

    "- **✅ Do:** \"YOU MUST analyze using context provided\" → Forces Haiku to think harder\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Prompting Rules\n",
    "1. **No escape hatches** - Don't give Haiku a way out\n",
    "2. **Full context** - Provide complete problem, error, and source\n",
    "3. **Directive tone** - \"YOU MUST\", \"CRITICAL\", \"REQUIRED\"\n",
    "4. **Inference rules** - Tell Haiku HOW to infer missing pieces\n",

    "✅ TEST 2: Grace (FORECAST) - Failure modes identified\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Fail-Closed Prompting Works\n",
    "When you remove escape hatches (\"if you can't, output NEED_INFO\"), Haiku works harder and delivers better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Full Context > Truncated Context\n",
    "Even though full context is longer, it enables Haiku to infer missing pieces instead of asking for clarification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Fresh Context Per Agent (Anti-Rot)\n",
    "Each agent sees ONLY what it needs, preventing narrative drift and cumulative errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Format Examples > Descriptions\n",
    "Showing an exact example (with all prefixes, line numbers, etc.) works better than just describing the format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Adapt This to Your Own Data\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Replace test data** in cells above with your SWE-bench instances\n",
    "2. **Load from SWE-bench:** `DATA_DIR = Path.home() / \"Downloads/benchmarks/SWE-bench-official\"`\n",
    "3. **Run through pipeline:** Scout → Grace → Judge → Solver → Skeptic\n",
    "4. **Collect results:** Each phase produces a JSON artifact\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sharing This Notebook\n",
