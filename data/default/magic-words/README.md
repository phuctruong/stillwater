# Magic Words Database

Magic words are GPS coordinates in knowledge space. Just as GPS uses a small set of satellites to locate any point on Earth, magic words use a small set of universal concepts to locate any piece of knowledge in a corpus. Instead of loading 115.6KB of full context for every query, you extract 2-4 magic words from the query and load only the 3KB of knowledge indexed under those coordinates — a 97% compression ratio that delivers 10-40x faster retrieval.

The database is organized as a four-tier tree. Tier 0 contains 15 trunk words (coherence, symmetry, entropy, etc.) that serve as universal anchors valid across every domain. Tier 1 contains 15 primary branch words (feedback, optimization, governance, etc.) that represent recurring structural patterns. Tier 2 contains 10 secondary branch words (inference, planning, ethics, etc.) at the edge of universality. Tier 3 is unbounded — domain-specific leaf words that emerge from usage and are promoted via the DELTA governance protocol. Every navigation path must start from a Tier 0 trunk word and refine downward; jumping directly to a leaf without a trunk anchor is a forbidden state.

The skill that governs navigation is `skills/phuc-magic-words.md`. It defines the state machine (EXTRACT_KEYWORDS → MAP_TO_TIER → LOAD_CONTEXT → VALIDATE_COMPRESSION → RESPOND), the forbidden states (FULL_CONTEXT_LOAD, TIER_SKIP, KEYWORD_HALLUCINATION, NAVIGATION_WITHOUT_TRUNK), and the three-rung verification ladder (RUNG_641 for correct extraction, RUNG_274177 for compression verification, RUNG_65537 for full audit trail). The schema for each entry in this database is defined in `data/default/magic-words/schema.md`. The seed database covering all 40 Tier 0–2 words is in `data/default/magic-words/stillwater.jsonl` — one JSON object per line, never wrapped in an array.

**Skill coverage (as of 2026-02-22):** 35 of 44 skill files include a `MAGIC_WORD_MAP` block that cross-references this database. Each skill's map lists the local domain terms, the canonical magic word they resolve to, the tier, the MW-ID, and a one-line compression note. This makes any skill retrievable via magic word navigation without loading the full file.
