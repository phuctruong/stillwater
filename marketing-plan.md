# Marketing Plan (Launch)

Repo: https://github.com/phuctruong/stillwater

Goal: get the right humans to run the notebooks, open issues, and turn this into something peer-reviewable and durable.

## Positioning (One Sentence)

Stillwater is a documentation-first repo (papers + notebooks + skills) for building AI workflows that feel less like vibes and more like rerunnable evidence.

## Primary Audiences

- Builders: engineers shipping LLM features who need repeatability and guardrails.
- Researchers: people who care about evaluation, evidence, and methodology.
- Safety-minded folks: people allergic to “trust me bro” outputs.
- Founders/devtools: people who recognize that reproducibility is a product feature.

## Launch Assets (Ship These First)

- `MESSAGE-TO-HUMANITY.md` (mission)
- `social-media.md` (copy/paste posts)
- `PHUC-ORCHESTRATION-SECRET-SAUCE.ipynb` (demo notebook)
- `papers/00-index.md` (map of concepts)
- `OTHER-COOl-STUFF.md` (ecosystem credibility + fun)

## Key Messages (Angles)

- Verification-first: “Rerun it. Inspect it. Don’t just believe it.”
- Portable demos: “Offline demo mode by default.”
- Honest claims: “If it’s not reproduced in repo, it’s a hypothesis.”
- Human story: open-sourcing “fire”, dragon rider metaphor, builder ethos.

## Content Calendar (14 Days)

Day 0:
- Publish repo + pin `MESSAGE-TO-HUMANITY.md`
- Post thread (X), LinkedIn post, Show HN

Day 1:
- Short demo clip/gif: nbconvert executing a notebook + clean outputs
- Post “How to run in 60 seconds” snippet

Day 2:
- Deep-dive post: “Why offline demo mode matters”
- Ask for reviewers: “I want you to break this”

Day 3:
- Paper spotlight: `papers/01-lane-algebra.md` (with one clear, practical example)

Day 4:
- Paper spotlight: `papers/02-counter-bypass.md`

Day 5:
- Paper spotlight: `papers/03-verification-ladder.md`

Day 6:
- “Behind the scenes”: how the skills are structured + why “don’t compress” matters

Day 7:
- Community roundup: thank-you post + link top issues/PRs

Days 8-14:
- Repeat 3 formats: demo snippet, paper spotlight, open question
- Start a weekly cadence: “Stillwater Weekly: what got verified this week?”

## Distribution Channels (Practical)

- GitHub: README + pinned issues + Discussions
- X: thread + short clips + “run this” posts
- LinkedIn: builder story + mission + reproducibility angle
- Hacker News: Show HN + follow-up with technical details
- Reddit: r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA, r/programming (different angles)
- Podcasts/newsletters: reach out with a 2-paragraph pitch + one runnable notebook

## Call To Action (Make It Easy)

Give people 3 asks max:
1. Star the repo.
2. Run one notebook.
3. Open one issue: “what confused you” or “what broke”.

## Metrics (Don’t Lie To Yourself)

Week 1 targets:
- 1k stars
- 20 issues (good issues are a sign people actually ran things)
- 5 external PRs
- 10 people who can reproduce the notebooks on their machine

## “Max Humor” Rule (Branding)

Humor is allowed, but keep these non-negotiables:
- no overclaiming
- no dunking on individuals
- no “growth hacks” that look like spam

If a post makes you laugh and a reviewer trust you more, ship it.
If it makes you laugh but makes a reviewer trust you less, delete it.
